# Randomio V2

> Miss the days of turning on the TV and just watching whatever is on? Emulate the ease of life with Randomio!

This is a remake of [Randomio](https://github.com/stevenld165/randomio-webapp) using Express.js as a backend, and TBD as a frontend. The goal of this remake is to incorporate more user-friendly UI, and individual user accounts that store user's lists of shows.

This is designed to refresh my coding skills, and create a full-stack app that implements an entire CRUD flow and authentication.
